IssueTracker-Mods
=================

Issue Tracker for my Minecraft Mods which sources are not already hosted on GitHub.

Post only confirmed bugs here. If you want to post a crash log (FML Log preferred), please paste it on Pastebin.com then attach a link.

- Check if there's an existing issue that's already been reported. If you do not see it listed, feel free to post a new issue.
- Your post needs to be as detailed as possible. You need to explicitly state which version of the mod you are using, your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac), and whether you are playing singleplayer or multiplayer. Don't expect the creator to guess, and it makes a huge difference in diagnosing the problem.
- Include information about conflicts with other mods.
- Locate your ForgeModLoader-client-0.log and/or ForgeModLoader-server-0.log file in your Minecraft directory. It must be placed in [spoiler][/spoiler] tags or as a Pastebin link. Skipping this step will greatly irritate the creator.
- Post your issue with the Mod name as a prefix. Example: [PortalGun] Item not rendering
- Failure to follow ALL these rules will result in your request either being ignored, unsolvable, or hostility from the creator. You have been warned.

Psst: You can also post requests, but no guarantee of it being implemented by the creator.
